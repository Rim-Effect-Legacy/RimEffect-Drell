		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of a family of Drell who were ripped from their colony world into the arms of a band of marauding slavers. [PAWN_possessive] was worked to the bone on a daily basis, but gained strength through it, and [PAWN_possessive] quietly collected resources until [PAWN_possessive] could escape. Their eventual flight from the slavers was bloody, but [PAWN_possessive] claimed [PAWN_possessive]'d never ever work hard for an uncaring boss again.</description>

Growing up among the humming internals, [PAWN_pronoun] learned to differentiate the subtle differences in background noise and learned much in the ways of keeping the ship running smoothly.</description>

Due to [PAWN_possessive] eidetic memory, [PAWN_pronoun] learned how to speed read so [PAWN_pronoun] could read even more as there is practically more books than [PAWN_pronoun] could ever read in [PAWN_possessive] lifetime. Ironically, [PAWN_pronoun] has difficulty in actually remembering the contents of the books unless given an external stimulus.</description>

Not without payment, the Asari actually honed and improved her skills as they were reflected back by [PAWN_nameDef], who in turn learned to move [PAWN_possessive] body as fast as [PAWN_pronoun] possibly could through purely reactionary behaviour.</description>
