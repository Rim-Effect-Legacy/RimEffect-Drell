	<description>Rim Effect is a large overhaul mod series, adding the story, races, objects, and conflicts of Mass Effect universe into RimWorld. The Mass Effect elements are not meant to stand out, and as such are blended into the RimWorld style by utilising the same naming conventions and writing styles.

Much like Vanilla Factions Expanded, the Rim Effect mod series comes divided into sub-modules, firstly to allow the players to pick exactly what elements they want in their games, secondly to ease the production and design process.

Rim Effect: Drell is an add-on module to the Core module. It introduces a brand new race called Drell - An omnivorous, reptile-like race that was rescued from their dying homeworld by the hanar. Since then, the drell have remained loyal to them for their camaraderie and have fit comfortably into galactic civilization. Their culture allows Drell to separate their mind from their body, helping them through hard times and work. They are predisposed to Kepral's syndrome, a lethal condition which can develop if Drell stays in cold temperatures too long.

This module brings two new apparel pieces - an Assassin set, as well as two new weapons into the game. Alliance Rapid Sniper Rifle is a great alternative to a DMR, whilst a Compact SMG will allow you to greatly increase the distance at which you eliminate threats.
